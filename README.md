JavaScript (*often abbreviated as JS*) is the programming language that enables web pages to respond to user interaction beyond the basic level. It was created in 1995, and is today one of the most famous and used programming languages. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
